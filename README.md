# DDOS-ATTACK-ON-POX-CONTROLLER-WITH-JOINT-ENTROPY-DETECTION-IN-SDN-NETWORKS
This project investigates Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks targeting the control plane of Software-Defined Networks (SDN) using a POX controller. The attack is implemented by flooding the controller with malicious traffic, causing resource exhaustion and network service disruption.

To counter the attack, the project implements a joint entropy–based detection mechanism that analyzes traffic behavior to identify anomalies in real time. Once an attack is detected, automated mitigation strategies are applied to limit malicious traffic and restore network availability. The project demonstrates how entropy-based techniques can enhance the security and resilience of SDN controllers against control-plane DDoS attacks.
